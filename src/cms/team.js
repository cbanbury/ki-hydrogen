  background: "We founded Ki Hydrogen out of a shared desire to tackle the toughest problems in climate - identifying the lack of cost-effective green hydrogen as a significant roadblock toward chemical and industrial decarbonisation. 'Ki' (pronounced 'key') in Japanese refers to living / fundamental energy - inspired by the longstanding hope for hydrogen to be a clean, carbon free alternative to our dependence on fossil fuels.",
